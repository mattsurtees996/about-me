            I'm originally from Tottenham, London. And before you ask, yes i
            support them! I'm a massive foodie... like most people I'm a sucker
            for a chinese takeaway but if i was to go out for dinner, my go to
            would have to be thai. I used to work in the hospitality industry, I
            was the manager at Pizza Express. Does it mean i like pizza though?
            In my spare time I played rugby for Norwich & Ice Hockey for London.
            This year my aim is to do half ironman, but im not sure if its going
            to happen yet. Its alot harder than I thought. I would love to do a
            London Marathon but unfortuantly i cant do both! (dont think my body
            can take it!) I'm also VERY partial to a good whiskey. Not with
            coke, just good old whiskey on the rocks. I have a few favourite,
            makers mark & bulleit.

            Now you know the basics, lets see if you can answer some simple
            questions. Think you got what it takes, take the quiz and see if you
            really are a know-it-all
